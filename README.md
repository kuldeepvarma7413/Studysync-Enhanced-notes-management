# StudySync - Enhanced Notes Management

# Background 
StudySync is a robust platform for enhanced notes management, initially developed using Django and hosted on Render at www.studysync.co.in. This repository represents a rewritten version of the application using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Cloudinary.

# About this Project
This project leverages the power of React and Node.js to provide a seamless frontend and backend experience. MongoDB is used for efficient data storage, while Cloudinary handles raw file storage, ensuring scalability and reliability. The platform also features a discussions module, enabling user collaboration and knowledge sharing.

# Getting Started
To use this application, follow these steps:

# Start the server:
Visit https://studysync-uunh.onrender.com/ and wait for the response. You should see "Hello from StudySync Server!" indicating that the server has started.

Access the application: Once the server is running, navigate to https://studysyncmern.netlify.app to explore the new UI and features of StudySync.

Note: As Render does not provide continuous instances of services, you need to start the server manually before accessing the application.
